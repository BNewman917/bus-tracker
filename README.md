<h2>Real-time Bus Tracker</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This is the Bust Tracker Exercise for Week 9 of MIT xPRO coding bootcamp.

<h3>Description</h3>

Tracks buses live using information from the [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority](https://www.mbta.com/) on a map generated using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) to show buses around the MIT and Harvard campuses in real-time.

<h3>How to Run</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Click 'Run Tracker' in the top left corner to populate buses on the map</li>
  <li>Show/Hide bus ID by clicking on each marker</li>
</ol>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

- More options to show different bus routes 
- Bus information displayed by hovering the mouse over each icon, rather than needing to click.
